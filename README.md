# Climate Change Project

This project aims to understand the usage of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to predict the behavior of climate
variables in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.

## Folders and data

By default you need to setup a ERA5 key to be able to download the data from the ERA5 API. With that done, you can run
the project. Then, it will automatically setup the folders for the local data usage.

## Downloading datasets

To download the datasets used here, run the `\scripts\download_era5.py` file.
